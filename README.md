# ChurnAnalysis
In this churn analysis, I was asked to create a statistical model that could predict whether a client is likely to end a product subscription within tghe first two years. For this I had to clean the data, create new data frames and apply a regression model that will classify the users based on selected variables.  
I used pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for the model implementation.
